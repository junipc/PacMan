# PacMan
Our project begins on a start screen with the title of the game, “Pac-Man!”. The player (user) has the option to design a custom character (the pac-man) and custom ghosts. There are two modes: classic mode and survival mode. Classic mode is identical to the original Pac-Man; survival mode has no collectible Pac-Dots (or Cherries or power-pellets), and rather has a goal to simply survive for the longest time possible with an increasing number of obstacles as time goes on.
