# PacMan
Our project begins on a start screen with the title of the game, “PacMan!”. The player (user) has the option to design a custom character (the PacMan) and custom ghosts. There are two modes: Classic mode and Survival mode. Classic mode is identical to the original PacMan; Survival mode has no collectible Pellets (or Cherries or PowerPellets), and rather has a goal to simply survive for the longest time possible with an increasing number of obstacles as time goes on.
